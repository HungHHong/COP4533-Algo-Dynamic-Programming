## Algorithm
- DP (similar to LCS but weighted)
- Handle match vs skip

## Experiments
- Test with given in/output first
- 10+ test cases
- Strings length ≥ 25
- Measure runtime
- Plot graph

## Written
- Recurrence + base case
- Explain correctness
- Pseudocode
- Time complexity

# How to run
To run all the inputs and create the graph data use the following code in the project folder directory in the terminal:
```
cd src
g++ main.cpp -o main
./main
```



# Question 1:

input1.in trough input10.in are all non trivial input files that we randomly generated. These files varied in input size, by having different alphabet lengths, lengths of A and lengths of B. We were able to use the main to solve these input files and get their running times for each in respect to length of A * length of B.

![Recurrence](experiments/graph.png)
The above graph shows that the run time of the algorithm should be O(M*N) as the graph is linear, where M is the size of string A, and N is the size of string B.


# Question 2: 
Recurrence equation:

![Recurrence](experiments/OverLeaf_Algo%20DP_P3_Q2.png)

The recurrence defines OPT(i,j) as maximum value of a common subsequence between the first i characters of string A and the first j characters of string B.

- Base case: If either string is empty, the value is 0.
- Case 1: If A[i] = B[j], we consider including the character or skipping from either string.
- Case 2: If A[i] ≠ B[j], we skip one character from either string.

This ensure that all possible choices are considered before and while avoiding recompute through dynamic programming

### Why our recurrence is correct
This recurrence works because the problem has optimal substructure, meaning we can build the optimal solution from smaller subproblems.

- Base case: If either string is empty, then there is no common subsequence, so the value is 0.
- Case 1: If `A[i] = B[j]`, then we have a choice:
  - we can include this character in our subsequence, which adds `v(A[i])` plus the best result from the smaller problem `OPT(i-1, j-1)`, or  
  - we can skip one of the characters and rely on previous results (`OPT(i-1, j)` or `OPT(i, j-1)`).


- Case 2: If `A[i] ≠ B[j]`, , then we cannot match these two characters, so we must skip one of them: 
  - `A[i]` → `OPT(i-1, j)`  
  or
  - `B[j]` → `OPT(i, j-1)`

Since these cases cover all possible valid choices, and each choice reduces to smaller subproblems, taking the maximum ensures we always get the best possible value. Hence it should be `OPT`

# Question 3:

```
/* original Pseudocode implementation:

DP_solver(A, B, v):
    m = length(A), n = length(B)

    // Initialize base cases
    for i = 0 to m:  M[i, 0] = 0
    for j = 0 to n:  M[0, j] = 0

    // Fill table bottom-up approach
    for i = 1 to m:
        for j = 1 to n:
            //Case 1: match
            if A[i] = B[j]:
                M[i, j] = max(v(A[i]) + M[i-1, j-1],
                              M[i-1, j],
                              M[i, j-1])
            //Case 2: not match
            else:
                M[i, j] = max(M[i-1, j], M[i, j-1])

    return M[m, n]

*/
```
This algorithm computes the maximum value of the HVLCS using a bottom-up approach in dynamic programming.

### Runtime

The algorithm fills an (m+1) × (n+1) table.

- There are m × n entries in the table.
- Each entry is computed in constant time O(1).

Therefore, the total runtime is O(M*N).
and our space is O(M*N).
